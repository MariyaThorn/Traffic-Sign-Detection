# Traffic-Sign-Detection
-----
Traffic sign detection by implementing Yolo11 the latest iteration in the Ultralytics YOLO series of real-time object detectors. 

**Note:** *The project is still in progress. I want to try out other architecture and compare the overall performance of the training.*

**Dataset**

The model was trained using 
[Traffic and Road Signs Computer Vision Project](https://app.roboflow.com/traffic-sign-detectionbounding-box/traffic-and-road-signs-rymdz/browse?queryText=&pageSize=50&startingIndex=0&browseQuery=true)

**Dependencies**
- Python 3.5+
- Ultralytics
- Pytorch(Optional)
